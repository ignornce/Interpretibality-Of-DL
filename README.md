# Interpretibality-Of-DL
Resources for ,Random Matrix theory and Machine Learning connections.This repo will serve as history + roadmap for learning ML and DL from math  and interpretability focused view for software engineers as myself.
+ Ideas for self learning and accumulation of research topics to follow.
+ Should fetch resources for math roots and complex analysis for ml and dl in the future from rmt perspective. 

## Goal
From the intution all knowledge is a fully connected component, will try to find connections between so far not connected components with respect to currrent knowledge graph. To have better understanding first ML then DL, main emphasis is on understanding what concepts represents and how they can be connected for the purpose of interpretability. 

# Todo
+ Add chatgpt sessions related
+ Search and add related papers for the topics mentioned in RM+ML doc.
+ Open new docs for every topic mentioned in RM+ML doc.
+ Add a section for mechanic interpretibality papers by anthropic and others.
