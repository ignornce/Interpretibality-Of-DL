##Goal
From the intution all knowledge is a fully connected component, will try to find connections between so far not connected components 
to have better understanding  first ML then DL. Main emphasis is on  understanding what concepts represent and how they can be connected
for the purpose of interpretability.

###Related Open Questions
+ Where is  the line between determenistic and probabilistic systems. (If all conditions known are there any probability at all  qm?)

  + This playlist covers essence + geometric meanings of linaer algeabra operations. Rather then memorising  formules to know how to calculate
  some quantites, it also shows why to calculate and what does the quantites stands for.
