## Random Matrix Theory Proves that Deep Learning Representations of GAN-data Behave as Gaussian Mixtures

## Theory Releavent Outcomes
+ "Implications for Data Distribution Laws: The theorem suggests that the Gram matrix behaves the same way as it would if the data followed a Gaussian
   Mixture Model with the same means and covariances. This implies a kind of universality in the spectral behavior of the Gram matrix,
   regardless of the specific data distribution laws, as long as they satisfy the conditions of being concentrated vectors."
### Application Relavent Outcomes
+ "In practice, this means that to evaluate a representation network, one could analyze the mean and variance of the feature vectors it produces. 
If these vectors effectively capture the underlying structure of the data (as represented by their statistical moments),
it indicates that the network is doing a good job of creating useful and informative representations."
